Q. 1:


Youâ€™re given a m x m matrix. Write a function to rotate submatrix within the matrix by 90degree clock wise. Function takes x and y as starting row and column coordinate of matrix and N as size of submatrix as argument. Inplace rotation was required. 

Q. 2:
You are given a sorted array containing both negative and positive values. Re-sort the array taking absolute value of negative numbers. Your complexity should be O(n)

Ex. A = {-8,-5,-3,-1,3,6,9}
Output: {-1,-3,3,-5,6,-8,9} 

Q. 3:
Wap to find subsets that contains equal sum in an array:

for eg{1,2,3,4,2}->{1,2,3}&&{4,2}
{1,1,3,3,2,8}->{1,3,3,2}&&{1,8}
{1,3,4,7}->no subset 

Q. 4:
Given a text string and a sample string. Find if the characters of the sample string is in the same order in the text string.. Give a simple algo..

Eg.. TextString: abcNjhgAhGjhfhAljhRkhgRbhjbevfhO
Sample string :NAGARRO 

Q.5
Given an array of size MxN and coordinates of starting of subarray (x, y). You need to rotate that subarray and then print the full array after rotation.

Q.6
Given a string, say sentence=" this is crazy and fun" and a list, say name=["is", "fun"]. Now you need to capitalize on the first letter of every word in the given string which is not present in the list.

Q.7
Given three sorted arrays A, B, and C. Write the most efficient algorithm to find the 5th largest element among the three arrays.

Q.8
Return the character which occurs for the maximum numbers of times in the Input String.
If multiple characters occur with the same highest frequency then return "0".
Input : Input1: abcdd

Q.9
A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that is divisible only by itself and the number 1.

Given 'n' (1 <= n <= 100000), find the nth prime number.
Input : An integer n

Q. 10
A Derangement is a permutation of n elements, such that no element appears in its original position. For example, a derangement of {0, 1, 2, 3} is {2, 3, 1, 0}.

Given a number n, find the total number of Derangements of a set of n elements.
Input : 1st Input: n = 2

For two elements say {0, 1}, there is only one
possible derangement {1, 0}

2nd Input: n = 3

For three elements say {0, 1, 2}, there are two
possible derangements {2, 0, 1} and {1, 2, 0}


Q.11
Every character in the input string is followed by its frequency.
Write a function to decrypt the string and find the nth character of the decrypted string. If no character exists at that positionthen then return "-1".
For eg:- If the input string is "a2b3" the decrypted string is "aabbb".
Note: The frequency of encrypted string cannot be greater than a single digit i.e.<10.

Explanation:

The decrypted string is "abccc", hence the 5th character in the decrypted string is "c".
Input : Input Specification:
Input1: A string.
Input2:5

Q.12
Given a number of objects N(non-repetitive object) Find the number of arrangements in which no objects occur at original positions.
Input : Input1: N, the number of Objects.
Input1: 3
