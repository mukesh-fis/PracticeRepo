Q. 1:

Youâ€™re given a m x m matrix. Write a function to rotate submatrix within the matrix by 90degree clock wise. Function takes x and y as starting row and column coordinate of matrix and N as size of submatrix as argument. Inplace rotation was required. I gave brute force I.e. With extra memory.

Q. 2:
You are given a sorted array containing both negative and positive values. Resort the array taking absolute value of negative numbers. Your complexity should be O(n)

Ex. A = {-8,-5,-3,-1,3,6,9}
Output: {-1,-3,3,-5,6,-8,9} 

Q. 3:
Wap to find subsets that contains equal sum in an array:

for eg{1,2,3,4,2}->{1,2,3}&&{4,2}
{1,1,3,3,2,8}->{1,3,3,2}&&{1,8}
{1,3,4,7}->no subset 

Q. 4:
Given a text string and a sample string. Find if the characters of the sample string is in the same order in the text string.. Give a simple algo..

Eg.. TextString: abcNjhgAhGjhfhAljhRkhgRbhjbevfhO
Sample string :NAGARRO
